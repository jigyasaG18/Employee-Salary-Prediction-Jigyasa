## üß≠ Introduction

In a world where data is abundant but insights are scarce, PayNexus attempts to bridge the gap between raw employment records and intelligent salary prediction. The core idea behind PayNexus is to democratize predictive salary insights and make them accessible to job seekers, HR departments, and compensation analysts.

This application answers one of the most common questions in the professional world: **"What salary can I expect based on my profile?"** PayNexus is a fully interactive, ML-powered web app that predicts salaries using real-world data. This project was developed as a comprehensive internship assignment and demonstrates complete ownership over an end-to-end machine learning product ‚Äî from raw data ingestion to deployment.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Inconsistent salaries across similar roles and inadequate salary transparency can leave both employers and job seekers uncertain. PayNexus addresses the following:

* Can we predict an employee's salary with reasonable accuracy given a few basic attributes?
* Can such predictions be scaled for batch processing and automated from unstructured sources (resumes)?
* Can HR professionals benchmark offered salaries against industry standards?

---

## üßæ Dataset and Feature Overview

The dataset used in this project was curated from publicly available employee salary data across various industries and job roles. After rigorous cleaning and preprocessing, the dataset had the following attributes:

* **Age**: Continuous numerical variable.
* **Gender**: Categorical (Male, Female, Other).
* **Education Level**: Categorical (High School, Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, PhD, Other).
* **Job Title**: Categorical ‚Äî over 100 roles including Data Scientist, Software Engineer, etc.
* **Years of Experience**: Numeric, continuous.
* **Salary**: Target variable (numeric, annual income in USD).

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed both in Jupyter Notebook and integrated into the app. Insights included:

* Salary increases almost linearly with years of experience.
* Job title is a high-impact feature; salaries vary widely by role.
* Higher education levels generally correlate with higher earnings.
* Gender disparities exist in some roles and are noted in visualizations.

**Visuals included:**

* Histograms
* Countplots
* KDEs
* Correlation matrices

---

## üõ† Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline was developed using `scikit-learn` and exported using `joblib`. Steps included:

* Handling missing values
* Standardizing numerical fields (Age, Experience)
* One-hot encoding categorical variables
* Removing outliers via IQR and Z-score methods
* Exporting preprocessor as `preprocessor.pkl`

---

## üß† Machine Learning Modeling

In this section, we evaluate several machine learning models to predict salaries based on employee attributes. Each model brings unique theoretical strengths, implementation considerations, and performance characteristics.

### 1. Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple yet foundational technique in supervised learning. It models the relationship between independent features (e.g., age, experience) and a continuous target variable (salary) by fitting a straight line.

**Key Concepts:**

* Assumes linear relationships among variables
* Sensitive to multicollinearity and outliers
* Easy to interpret and explain

**Usage in PayNexus:**
Used as a baseline model. While it provided moderately good results, it lacked the flexibility to model nonlinear relationships among complex job roles and salary patterns.

---

### 2. Decision Tree Regressor

Decision Trees work by recursively splitting the data into subgroups based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure.

**Key Concepts:**

* Handles both categorical and numerical data
* Can model complex, nonlinear relationships
* Prone to overfitting unless pruned

**Usage in PayNexus:**
The model provided much better performance than linear regression but tended to overfit due to deep branching, especially when salary variance within job titles was high.

---

### 3. Random Forest Regressor ‚úÖ

Random Forest is an ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs (via averaging in regression).

**Key Concepts:**

* Reduces overfitting by averaging predictions
* Handles feature importance inherently
* Scalable and robust to noise and outliers

**Usage in PayNexus:**
Chosen as the final model due to its best-in-class performance. It balanced accuracy and generalization, worked well with mixed data types, and handled categorical features with one-hot encoding effectively.

---

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)

KNN is a lazy learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the average of the closest 'k' training samples.

**Key Concepts:**

* No training phase; stores all data
* Distance-based; sensitive to feature scaling
* Struggles in high-dimensional spaces

**Usage in PayNexus:**
Performed poorly due to the curse of dimensionality and varying scales in job titles and education. Best suited for small, low-dimensional datasets.

---

### 5. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

SVR tries to fit the best line within a threshold (epsilon) that defines a margin of tolerance around the true outputs.

**Key Concepts:**

* Uses kernel trick to handle nonlinear data
* Good for small to medium-sized datasets
* Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning

**Usage in PayNexus:**
Did not generalize well. While powerful in theory, it was computationally intensive and struggled with feature diversity.

---

### 6. XGBoost Regressor

Extreme Gradient Boosting is a powerful ensemble technique that sequentially adds trees to correct the errors of previous ones.

**Key Concepts:**

* Uses boosting: focuses on hard-to-predict samples
* Incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting
* Highly efficient and widely used in competitions

**Usage in PayNexus:**
Very close performance to Random Forest, and in some cases slightly better in smaller validation splits. However, it required more complex tuning, and the marginal gain wasn‚Äôt significant enough to justify replacing Random Forest in deployment.

### Algorithms Evaluated:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **KNN Regressor**
5. **Support Vector Regressor**
6. **XGBoost Regressor**

All models were trained and validated using 80:20 train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation.

## üèÜ Chosen Model Justification

The **Random Forest Regressor** emerged as the top model based on accuracy (R¬≤), and low error (MAE, RMSE). It also generalizes well, requires minimal tuning, and performs robustly even with unseen job roles. This model was serialized and deployed.
